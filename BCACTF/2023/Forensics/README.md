The challenge has given a [ctf.gif](https://github.com/m4karoni/CTF/assets/70287409/618d6c5a-c714-45f3-9ff2-d74319e1f030) file where if we download it, we can see that it's a qr code, but someone drew stuffs on it so we can't scan it properly.
  
In my experience, Photoshop is always a go to for me when dealing with gif files, and so I did.

In photoshop, these gifs are layers of different images that just repeat in a loop, so I used the Clone Stamp Tool to try to "erase" the drawings

After you've done it, it will be something like this

It is the closest that I can do.  
It still have a little smudge on it but it's sufficient to read the qr code.
